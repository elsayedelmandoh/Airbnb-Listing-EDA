## Project Overview

This project involves performing an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Airbnb listings data for a specific city. The analysis aims to identify trends, patterns, and insights within the dataset related to factors such as price, availability, location, and property types.

## Data Collection

The dataset used for this analysis was obtained from Inside Airbnb. The dataset contains information about various Airbnb listings, including attributes such as host details, property location, room type, pricing, reviews, and more.

## Data Preprocessing

- Data was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame for manipulation and analysis.
- Missing values were identified and handled using appropriate methods such as imputation or removal.
- Date columns were converted to the appropriate datetime format for further analysis.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

- Basic statistical summaries were calculated for numeric variables.
- Visualization techniques were employed to understand the distribution of key variables, such as price and availability.
- Categorical variables were analyzed to uncover insights into room types, neighborhoods, and more.

## Insights and Visualizations

- Room type distribution was visualized using a count plot.
- The distribution of price and availability across different neighborhoods was explored using violin plots.
- Time trends were analyzed by plotting average price, number of reviews, and availability over different months.

## Handling Outliers

- Outliers in the 'price' variable were detected using statistical methods.
- Outliers were either capped or removed from the dataset based on their impact and distribution.

## Correlation Analysis

- Correlation coefficients were calculated to measure the relationship between numeric features and the target variable, 'price'.
- A heatmap visualization was used to identify features with the highest correlations with 'price'.

## Time Trends Analysis

- The analysis included plotting average price, number of reviews, and availability over different months.
- Insights were drawn from the plots to identify trends and patterns over time.

## Conclusion

In this project, an exploratory data analysis of Airbnb listings data was conducted to uncover insights and trends related to price, availability, location, and property types. Visualizations and statistical analyses were employed to provide valuable insights for potential business decisions or further research.
